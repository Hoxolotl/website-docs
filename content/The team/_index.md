BADGE.TEAM is a colaboration effort of multiple engineers, designers and enthousiasts who use their skills to create awesome badges for non-profit hacker events.

Up until now our main design goal has been to create badges that are not just awesome, but are also able to show the users' name at all times.
We aim to have the badges ready for handout together with the wristbands at the enterance, so that people can enjoy their new gadget right from the start of the event.

Our first badge was for SHA2017, where we created a device that combined a powerfull WiFi capable microcontroller with an E-ink screen. This combination allows for both extendibility using apps as well as for making sure the badge is actually a name showing badge.
Since then we've worked on multiple other badges, which all in their own way try to let the user show their name and express themselves.

Some special credit has to be given to some people from this ever growing list of contributors.

## Sebastian Oort
Sebastian: our team lead and twitter god.

He provides us with excelent marketing, finds sponsors and has the leadership skills required to turn a bunch of volunteers into a functional development team.

## Bas van Sisseren
Jack of all trades, master of e-inks.

This awesome software engineer did most of the low level firmware for the SHA2017 badge. He reverse engineered the meaning behind the values sent to the e-ink display in the LUT, enabling us to greatly improve update rates and even do greyscale!

## Anne Jan Brouwer

Hatcher of the hatchery. Manager of OTAs. Without this guy the hatchery wouldn't have existed.

## Renze Nicolai

Wants to be an electrical engineer, but in reality he is stuck with coding up firmware.
Responsible for making a platform out of our SHA2017 firmware, while also doing some very quick 'n dirty Python work.

He's both good at fixing and introducing bugs, but is always ready to answer your questions and issues on Github.

## Nikolett
Nikolett designed our mascots: Badge.r and the excited small snake. You can find more art and information on her [website](https://ankhaneko.wixsite.com/portfolio) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/Nekolett).

## Tom Clement
He did the CampZone 2019 badge.

(He's our very own one man army.)
