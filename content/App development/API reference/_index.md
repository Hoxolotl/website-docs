Welcome to the API reference for the BADGE.TEAM platform firmware.

This reference describes all officially supported APIs of our platform. We try to keep these APIs as stable as possible. There are many more (undocumented) APIs in the firmware, all of which may change at any time!

As of August 2019 the firmware has not reached a stable state yet. This means that all APIs may still be changed and that platform support has not been completed for all supported targets.

# List of documented APIs

 - [The display API: for drawing on the screen of your device](display)
 - [The system API: for starting apps and returning to the launcher](system)
 - [The WiFi API: for connecting to a WiFi network](wifi)
 - [The terminal API: for doing fancy stuff over USB-serial or via Telnet](terminal)
